    description: I spent almost 5 years at Apple, building the best fitness software in the world. I built and managed Fitness+, the first fitness service built for Apple Watch. My team built user experiences on iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, and Apple Watch that spanned customer acquisition and onboarding, personalized recommendations, in-session workout experiences, and more. Before Fitness+, I worked on personalized activity coaching and activity sharing, two more features that help users love their Apple Watch.  
    I am a strong advocate for women and underrepresented developers, and made meaningful changes at Apple for these groups. I founded and led Women on Watch and Women in Fitness, and spearheaded changes for more equitable, transparent recruiting processes. The work I did in these areas fueled and inspired me in every facet of my professional life.
