    description: I spent almost 5 years at Apple, building the best fitness software in the world. I built and managed Fitness+, the first fitness service built for Apple Watch. My team built user experiences on iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, and Apple Watch that spanned customer acquisition and onboarding, personalized recommendations, in-session workout experiences, and more. Before Fitness+, I worked on personalized activity coaching and activity sharing, two more features that help users love their Apple Watch.

    description: At Stanford, I studied Computer Science with a focus on Human Computer Interaction. As a student who entered college wanting to be a doctor, I was drawn to the impact of computing across industries, especially healthcare. My classes focused on computer science fundamentals as well as cross disclipinary work on the impact of software on ethics, human rights, and consumer behavior.

    description: I was diagnosed with early menarche (early puberty) at the age of 9, which started me on a journey of period advocacy work that has spanned decades. In high school and college, I conducted educational workshops with the Girl Scouts of America, and I conducted research at Stanford on the impacts on adolescents of stress during puberty.
